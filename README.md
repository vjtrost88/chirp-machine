# chirp-machine
I want a bot to tweet for me because my lazy ass can't remember to do it on a schedule.

### TODO:
- write a ChirpMachine class that can...
1. post a tweet
2. pull content from google sheets

- set up google sheets integration somehow
- post content to google sheets in bulk
- write a cron job to automate the pulling of a tweet

### The Big Plan
1. Spend dedicated time writing out good tweets and putting them into a google sheet
2. Have the cron job run the chirp machine at optimal tweeting times and remove used tweets from the google sheet
3. Maybe dockerize and run on the GPU box?
